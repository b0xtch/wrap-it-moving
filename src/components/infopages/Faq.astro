              If your move date has changed, not to worry.  We are happy to accommodate with a rescheduling.  We also keep the moving deposit for 2 scheduling.  From your 3rd scheduling, the moving deposit no longer goes towards the total bill due at the end of your move, and you will need to pay a new deposit. We require a 24 hour notice.

              Items packed by the Wrap-it Moving team are insured under Article 10 of Schedule 4, Specified Conditions of Carriage — Household Goods in the <a href="https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/crbc/crbc/26_58_multi"> Motor Vehicle Act Regulations of British Columbia.</a> This insurance provides minimal coverage at no additional cost.  The maximum coverage is $1.32 per kilogram per article.

              For example, if your dresser weighing at 40kg is damaged during the move, you would receive 40kg x $1.32 = $52.80 compensation.
              You can trust our experienced and dedicated Wrap-it Moving team to make every effort to make sure your items will be transported safely, with extra care.  However, you are more than welcomed to purchase additional coverage insurance if you wish.
              
              For full-value protection or special item coverage, please check out insurance brokers near you for something that fits your needs and your budget, and purchase it before the moving day.
              
              All claims have to be made within 24 hours from the completion of the move.
